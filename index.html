                Matthew Murdock was blinded as a result of exposure to radioactive materials at the 
                age of nine. His father, Battlin' Jack Murdock, was a boxer that refused to back down.
                Orphaned as a result of the rampant crime in Hell's Kitchen, one would expect him to
                give up... not today, he said.<br>
                Daredevil, with his heightened senses, fighting skills and thirst for justice, has become
                one of the most influential heroes of all time. Created by Stan Lee and Bill Everett and 
                improved upon by the legendary Frank Miller, he is as much a symbol of hope and security
                as all the Avengers combined.

            <p class="charatxt">
                As the Daredevil, he has saved countless lives and brought a sense of safety to
                nightime Hell's Kitchen. However, the ever unwearied spirit of Matt Murdock displays
                a proficiency not just on the battlefield, but also in a court of Law.<br>
                A skilled orator and well versed in the Law, Matt Murdock has undertaken the defense
                of New York's innocent in the daytime as well. He has protected the civil rights and 
                liberties of common New Yorkers on numerous occasions and has brought the criminals
                of the day to justice.<br>
                From defending tenants against greedy landlords to teaching his clients how to defend
                themselves once he couldn't, the list of what Matthew has done for his city is far from
                short.
